// Entry Conditions (Momentum + AI Sector Correlation)
1. Breakout Entry:
   - Close > Upper Bollinger Band(20,2)
   - MACD(12,26,9) > Signal Line
   - Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX) 5-day return > 2%
   - Volume surge > 2 * 21-day median

2. Dip-Buying Entry:
   - Price retraces 15%+ from 52w high
   - Put/Call Ratio > 1.3 (derivatives fear)
   - Positive divergence: Price makes lower low while RSI(14) higher low
   - Institutional accumulation detected (Volume*Price slope > 0.7)

// Exit Framework
- Profit Pyramid:
  1. First Target: 8% gain (trim 40%)
  2. Second Target: 15% gain (trim 30%)
  3. Let remaining ride with trailing stop

- Adaptive Stop System:
  Initial: 7% below entry
  Tightens to 3% below recent peak after 5 green days
  Emergency stop: 12% daily drop triggers market order

// AI Conference Strategy (Event-Driven)
- Activation: 72 hours before major AI events (GTC, CES)
- Vertical Spread Parameters:
  * 45-60 DTE
  * Buy 1.5 delta call / Sell 3 delta call
  * IV Percentile > 55%
  * Close at 50% max profit or 24h post-event

// Risk Controls
- Exposure Management:
  Max sector allocation: 25% portfolio
  VAR-based sizing: 
  PositionSize = (95% CVaR * PortfolioValue) / (ATR(14) * âˆšDaysHeld)

- Circuit Filters:
  1. SOXX 5-day drop > 8%: Suspend new entries
  2. VIX spike > 35: Reduce exposure by 70%
  3. Fed Meeting Days: 50% position cap

// Advanced Indicators
- AI Sentiment Score:
  0.6*(News Sentiment NLP) + 0.25*(Insider Trading Score) + 0.15*(Patent Filing Momentum)

// Data Pipeline
1. Core Feed:
   - NVDA 15-min bars w/ Level 2 depth
   - Earnings whisper numbers
   - TSMC production reports (supply chain proxy)

2. Augmented Data:
   - SOXX 5-min correlation data
   - AI Research Paper Publication Frequency Index
   - GPU Market Share Weekly Estimates

// Backtest Setup
- Benchmark: SOXX
- Fees: Fidelity Institutional Pricing
- Slippage: SpreadImpactModel(0.01)
- Warmup: 300 bars (for Bollinger/MACD convergence)
- Optimization:
  Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - 50 iterations
  - Acquisition Function: Expected Improvement
  - Noise Level: 0.05

// Known Constraints
1. Assumes stable chip export policies
2. Limited modeling of fab facility black swans
3. AI regulation changes simulated via sentiment shocks
4. Competitor breakthroughs modeled as sector beta shocks

// Implementation Requirements
- Custom NLP module for earnings call analysis
- Real-time supply chain disruption alerts
- Requires GPU utilization rate data stream
- Critical: Implement dark pool print detection

**DISCLAIMER:** This strategy contains forward-looking assumptions about AI sector growth. NVDA's extreme volatility requires constant monitoring. Always maintain event risk hedges.
